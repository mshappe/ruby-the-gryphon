h3.header 0.3.5 Cumulonimbus Contankerous Capering Crunchy Creaky Cloudy Camelopard
p Several "low-hanging fruit" fixes out of the issues list, mostly around making things
  look a bit neater. Events are now grouped by month, for example.

h3.header 0.3.4 Contankerous Capering Crunchy Creaky Cloudy Camelopard
p Only user-visible change is that all "attached" images should actually work now. 
  The code we were using them to convert them from being stored in one DB to 
  being stored in another DB as blobs was no longer working for some reason.
  Rather than beat up on it when we knew we didn't want to go that way long-term, 
  the conversion magic now pushes the images to Amazon S3, and Ruby The Gryphon now looks there.

ul
  li Official revival of the project
  li Moved release notes to the menu bar
  li Tweaked a couple of obvious issues
  li Plans to actually advance to usability

h3.header 0.3.2 Contankerous Capering Crunchy Camelopard
ul
  li Added hints that should give more responsive results on smaller screens
  li Front page events were getting rotated out based on start rather than end, so a long event like WW dropped off while the event was happening

    | Layout changes
    ul
      li Body font is now Nunito. Heading font is still Garamond EB
      li Single-column layout
      li If you can manage anything, it shows up in a cog menu, which right now is the ONLY dropdown in most layouts.
